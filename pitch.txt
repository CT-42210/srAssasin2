hello ___.

I'm Nick, and I go to Mobeard. I was fed up with the BS that comes from running a senior assassin game so I built an app to manage it for me, and I am reaching out to ask if your school wants to use it too.

The app has a couple main features:
one, it does the brute work for you- a computer manually shuffles teams and assigns targets. It can also automatically eliminate teams for whatever reason (like if they don't get all their targets out).
The second main feature is a voting system. You can disable it if necessary, but allowing people to vote makes sure that a particularly bitchy admin cant ruin the game for everyone.
Third, it allows the admin to play the game. because a computer randomizes the teams, no one person, even the admin, has information that anyone else doesn't. I am sure that your game is far more competitive than mine, and that no one probably wants to sit out and spend hours in spreadsheets managing it all.

You can check out my school's deployment right now at https://crimsassions.com . The rules, game logic, and whatever else is completely customizable to your school (with some exceptions).
Here is a youtube playlist with videos demonstrating how it works too. https://youtu.be/4kNHCQOm8bM?list=PLK0l1W9vmPjd8tsnRSJYHR8Z54zKtbgpC
I need about $200 to host the app. we can figure price out after that.

Let me know if your interested. Cheers
